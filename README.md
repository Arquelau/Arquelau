<h3> ðŸ“š About me: </h3>
<p> ðŸ’»  I'm a Computer Scientist working as Software Developer.</p>
<p> ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·  SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos, SP. </p>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li> 
    I studied at UNIFESP from 2014 until 2019. In 2016, I finished the Science and Technology graduation, and in 2019 I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</li>
  <li> 
    Nowadays, I'm used to code in TypeScript, because I enjoy working with NodeJs. However, since the beginning of my graduation, I've already worked with C, C#, Java, Python, R, PHP, SQL and a few other programming languages and tools, so i guess I can easily adapt to any working environment that involves         computer science. </li>
  <li> 
    In my free time, I like to watch some streaming content creators, play some games and coding personal projects.
